               The Goldfinch is a painting of a chained goldfinch by Carel Fabritius, a Dutch Golden Age artist. Signed and dated 1654, it is now in the collection of the Mauritshuis in The Hague, Netherlands. The work is a trompe-l'œil oil on panel measuring 33.5 by 22.8 centimetres (13.2 in × 9.0 in) that was once part of a larger structure, perhaps a window jamb or a protective cover.

         Baby Driver is an action film written and directed by Edgar Wright. First released on June 28, 2017, it tells the story of a young Atlanta-based getaway driver, played by Ansel Elgort (pictured), who is on a quest for freedom from a life of crime with his lover Debora (Lily James). The film also features Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Eiza González, Jamie Foxx and Jon Bernthal in supporting roles. Baby Driver was a project Wright had contemplated for over two decades, and his early directing experience shaped his ambitions for the project. Filming took place over four months, using stunts, choreography and in-camera shooting.
